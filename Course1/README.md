# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Standard steps for building a Neural Network

1. Define the model structure (such as number of input features)
2. Initialize the model's parameters
3. Loop:
    * Calculate current loss (forward propagation)
    * Calculate current gradient (backward propagation)
    * Update parameters (gradient descent)
